Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. 
The output should display the month as a numerical value, product ID, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. 
Sort the output first by month and then by product ID.

reviews Table:
Column Name	    Type
review_id	      integer
user_id	        integer
submit_date	    datetime
product_id	    integer
stars	          integer (1-5)

Solution:
SELECT EXTRACT(month from submit_date) as mth, product_id, round(Avg(stars),2)
FROM reviews
group by mth,product_id
order by mth asc, product_id;
