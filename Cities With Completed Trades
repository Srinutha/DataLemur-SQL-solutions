Assume you're given the tables containing completed trade orders and user details in a Robinhood trading system.
Write a query to retrieve the top three cities that have the highest number of completed trade orders listed in descending order. Output the city name and the corresponding number of completed trade orders.
tradesTable:
Column Name	      Type
order_id	       integer
user_id	         integer
quantity	       integer
status	         string ('Completed', 'Cancelled')
date	           timestamp
price	           decimal (5, 2)

users Table:
Column Name	            Type
user_id	                integer
city	                  string
email	                  string
signup_date           	datetime

Solution:
SELECT city, count(*) as total_orders FROM trades T 
join users U on T.user_id=U.user_id
where T.status='Completed'
group by city
order by total_orders desc limit 3;
